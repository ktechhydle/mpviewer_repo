# How It Works...
### 1. Set up the course:
- Use the libraries tab to add Course Elements as needed, or import your own SVG files to add features to the Canvas.
- Scale, Rotate, or Group Elements to achieve the desired course setup.
### 2. Draw your path:
- Use the `Path` tool to draw your line along the course.
- The Path colors and stroke styles can be changed for any reason you find necessary.
### 3. Label your path:
- Use the `Line and Label` tool to create Leader lines along your Path.
- Edit these labels to include your tricks along each part of the Path.
### 4. And it's that simple. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> MPRUN can be a simple software, and a powerful software when necessary.

- Elements are named:
	> You will often see elements named `Path` or `Group` on the Canvas. ***Hover your mouse over an element to see the element name, or name the element via the `Name` tool.***
- Insert different files:
	> Insert PNG, JPEG, SVG, or even TIFF files onto the canvas.
- Export multiple file types:
	> Export the canvas as a PNG, JPEG, SVG, or even a PDF file ***(beta)***.

# Why MPRUN Though?
MPRUN can build a solid plan going into competitions, creating a proper mindset for athletes.
#### Why is that important though? 
This is important because it ensures athletes don't go into competitions without a plan and a 'just wing it' mindset.

# TL;DR
> [!IMPORTANT]
> MPRUN is a comprehensive software designed for planning snowboard and ski competition runs. Users can customize courses, draw their path, label tricks, and do so much more. It promotes strategic planning for athletes, preventing a 'just wing it' mentality and fostering a focused mindset for competitions.
